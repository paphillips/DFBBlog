<h1>Where and when is my data?</h1>
<hr>
<div class="content">
	<h2>Going the custom DSP route</h2>
	<p>The impetus for the DFB mini IDE and this site was a design I was working on. The advanced requirements were more than the standard digital filter component could provide.</p>
	<p>I needed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>8 channel ADC threshold and peak monitoring in real-time</li>
		<li>4 channel x 24-sample linear regression slope calculation to run in the background on demand</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These were too heavy to do on the CPU with the other required task and latency target so I set out to learn DFB assembler.</p>
	<p>During this learning cycle I found that while the datasheet covers each technical area in detail it lacks a macro view and is somewhat opaque in the pipelining aspects. As with most datasheets, it takes a long time for all of the information to 'click'.</p>
	<p>The learning curve can be steep on DFB assembler due to several factors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The assembler simulator provides limited visibility of the state of each subsystem within the DFB</li>
		<li>The pipeline delays are not directly documented. The datasheet indicates:<blockquote>"The instruction pipelining follows Figure 3 for the DFB processor.<br>The diagram shows the locations of the pipeline registers so you can determine the instruction pipeline latency."</blockquote>
		<li>Perhaps the pipelining is obvious to a professional DSP engineer, but as a newcomer to the domain I did not find it to be clear</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Honorable mention</h2>
	<p>In working my way up the learning curve I found very few resources outside of the datasheet, but these stood out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://arttools.blogspot.com/2016/02/psoc-5lp-dfb-assembler.html">Magnus Lundin</a> has been active on the PSoC forums with DFB advice, and also has a site with well-documented example code.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.hackster.io/antedeluvian/measuring-an-rms-signal-on-a-psoc5-a9fa6d">Aubrey Kagan</a> posted a nice article on calculating RMS using the DFB.</li>
		<li>Chris Keeser and Dan Sweet at Cypress worked on DFB assembler improvements in 2013 and posted <a href="http://www.cypress.com/forum/psoc-community-components/dfb-assembler-and-significantly-improved-simulator-component">a very informative post here</a> describing the pipeline delays. Look for the attachment "Download UsefulDFB_Info.zip" which contains a lot of information not found elsewhere with respect to the pipeline delays.</li>
		<li>There are also a number of examples in the <a href="https://community.cypress.com/search.jspa?q=(digital+filter+block)">Cypress developer forum</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In order to achieve my design objectives and maintain a reasonable cognitive load I decided to take a few weeks and build a mini-development environment for the DFB. Some of the benefits include:
	<ol>
		<li>Visual diagram of the pipeline delays - you can see when an instruction is queued, when data is loaded, when the calculations take place, and when the output is put on the datapath</li>
		<li>View of the data values as they move through the datapath</li>
		<li>Visual indication of active datapath as configured by the muxes</li>
		<li>Ability 'scrub' backward and forward through the code cycles</li>
		<li>Full detail of ACU / Data ram and address registers at each cycle</li>
		<li>Jump diagram to allow one to easily check that the ACU is positioned on the proper offset at each entry to a label</li>
		<li>Ability to 'schedule' globals ahead of time at specific cycles, instead of hand entering them</li>
		<li>A value converter to switch values between hex, integer, and DFB q.23 values one at a time or in bulk</li>
	</ol>
	<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">With the mini ID you may see <strong>where</strong> and <strong>when</strong> your data is inside the DFB, which is critical to efficient development. Being able to visualize the instruction pipelining while scrubbing back and forth drastically reduced my own learning curve, design, and test time frame.</div>
	<p>The Mini DFB IDE source is available <a href="https://github.com/paphillips/DFB">free and open source on github</a>.</p>
